## Data Analytics and the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) group project 

A group project: collaborated with four other MSc Data Science students to analyse data on student interaction with a VLE, student demographics and student performance. 

Data analysis was performed to find trends and relationships within the data. 

Python and Scikit-learn were used to develop models for classifying students into a high performing category or a low performing category. Used to determine, from the infomation given, if a student can be predicted to pass or fail their program. 

The original data came from the Open University Learning Analytics dataset. This can be downloaded from: https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset
